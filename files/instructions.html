    <h1>Welcome to the Cryptogram Game!</h1>
    <h2>The rules:</h2>
    <p>The rules to this game are quite simple. There will be a quote that will be displayed, but there's a catch.</p>
    <p>The quote will be randomly encoded with different letters representing the letters of the quote.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to guess each letter in the quote to eventually crack the quote.</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>How to:</h2>
    <p>To start the game, navigate to the following URL: localhost:9001/game</p>
    <p>The quote will be displayed and there will be two fields at the bottom of the page.</p>
    <p>On one field, you will enter the letter you want to replace from the above displayed encoding and on the other field, you will enter the letter you want to replace it with and then click 'Change Letters'.</p>
    <p>Every occurrence of that letter will then be displayed with the letter you guessed on top of the letter you replaced.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Good Luck!</h3>
